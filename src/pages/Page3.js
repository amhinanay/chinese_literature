        <strong>Classical Chinese Literature</strong> is characterized by works written in Classical Chinese, a literary form of the language that was used from the Zhou dynasty through the early 20th century. Some of the most famous works from this era include Confucius's <em>Analects</em>, Laozi's <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, and the historical narratives of <em>Records of the Grand Historian</em> by Sima Qian. Classical poetry flourished during the Tang dynasty, with poets like Li Bai and Du Fu creating timeless works that continue to be celebrated today.

        <strong>Chinese fiction</strong> began to flourish in the Ming and Qing dynasties, with masterpieces such as <em>Journey to the West</em>, <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em>, <em>Water Margin</em>, and <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em>. These novels are considered some of the greatest literary achievements in world literature, blending history, mythology, and social commentary with engaging storytelling.
